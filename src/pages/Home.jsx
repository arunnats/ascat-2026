          This time the event is organised in offline mode. The Department of
          Computer Science and Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra
          (BIT Mesra) officially organizes the symposium on its main campus in
          Jharkhand (Mesra, Ranchi), India. The symposium aims two-fold: to
          nurture cellular automata theories and explore cellular automata as
          technology. So all the theoretical aspects of cellular automata and
          their applications in any domain are within the scope of this
          symposium.
